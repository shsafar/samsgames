📅 NEW: Archive Access for Every Game!

Inspired by NYT Games, we've added a dedicated Archive button to all 13 puzzle games!

✨ What's New:
• Archive button on every game card
• View the past week's puzzles at a glance
• Beautiful calendar view with completion tracking
• Green checkmarks show completed puzzles
• Each game has its own color-coded archive
• Subscribers get instant access to 390+ past puzzles

🎯 How It Works:
Tap the Archive button on any game card to explore previous puzzles. Not a subscriber? You'll see a quick preview and can unlock the full archive anytime.

🔧 Testing Improvements:
• Tap "Statistics" 5 times to toggle test mode
• Easier testing of premium features

Enjoy revisiting your favorite puzzles! 🎉
